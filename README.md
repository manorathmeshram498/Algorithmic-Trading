# Stock Price Prediction and Trading Strategy

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict stock price movements and develop an algorithmic trading strategy. The model uses technical indicators and features engineered from historical stock data to forecast the direction of the stock price movement for the next day. The strategy is then backtested with transaction costs and risk management features, such as **stop-loss** and **take-profit**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based trading strategy that can predict whether the stock price will go up or down on the next trading day. The strategy is based on engineered features like **Moving Averages**, **RSI**, **MACD**, and other technical indicators. The model is trained on historical stock data and used to make buy/sell decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Stock Data**: Daily stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume).
- **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD) created to enhance predictive power.
- **Predictive Model**: Trained binary classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to predict price movement direction (Up/Down).
- **Trading Strategy**: Algorithmic trading strategy based on predictions.
- **Risk Management**: Stop-loss and take-profit features added to manage risk.
- **Backtesting**: Strategy performance backtested on historical data with transaction costs and slippage.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using **Cumulative Returns**, **Sharpe Ratio**, **Maximum Drawdown**, and more.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


The requirements.txt includes:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

xgboost

matplotlib

ta-lib (for technical indicators)

other necessary libraries

Dataset
The dataset consists of daily stock prices, which should be loaded from a CSV or API source such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. Make sure to prepare your dataset before training the model.

Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Create technical indicators for feature engineering (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).

2. Model Training:
Train a binary classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to predict the direction of the price movement.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Optimize the model using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

3. Trading Strategy Development:
Develop a simple trading strategy based on model predictions:

Buy if the model predicts an upward price movement.

Sell if the model predicts a downward price movement.

Implement transaction costs and slippage.

Introduce stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms for risk management.

4. Backtesting:
Backtest the strategy on historical data to evaluate performance.

Evaluate performance metrics such as:

Cumulative Returns

Sharpe Ratio

Maximum Drawdown

5. Optimization and Refinement:
Tune the model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

Refine the trading strategy to include more features, enhance performance, and manage risk.

Evaluation
The performance of the trading strategy is evaluated using key metrics:

Cumulative Return: Measures the total return over the backtest period.

Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return of the strategy.

Maximum Drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough loss during the backtest period.

Results
A comparison of the strategy's performance with a buy-and-hold approach shows how the modelâ€™s predictions impact the overall performance. The addition of risk management rules (stop-loss and take-profit) further refines the strategy.
